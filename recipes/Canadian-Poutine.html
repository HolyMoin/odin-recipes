    <h2>Instructions
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the gravy: In a small bowl, dissolve the cornstarch in the water and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>In a large saucepan, melt the butter. Add the flour and cook, stirring regularly, for about 5 minutes, until
            the mixture turns golden brown.
        </li>
        <li>Add the beef and chicken broth and bring to a boil, stirring with a whisk. Stir in about HALF the cornstarch
            mixture and simmer for a minute or so. If you'd like your gravy thicker, add a more of the cornstarch
            mixture, in small increments, as needed, to thicken.</li>
        <li>Season with pepper. Taste and add additional salt, if necessary, to taste. Make ahead and re-warm or keep
            warm until your fries are ready.</li>
        <li>For Deep-Fried Fries: Prepare your potatoes and cut into 1/2-inch thick sticks. Place into a large bowl and
            cover completely with cold water.</li>
        <li>Allow to stand at least one hour or several hours. When ready to cook, heat your oil in your deep fryer or
            large, wide, heavy cooking pot to 300° F.</li>
        <li>Remove the potatoes from the water and place onto a sheet of paper towel. Blot to remove as much excess
            moisture as possible.</li>
        <li>Add your fries to the 300°F oil and cook for 5-8 minutes, just until potatoes are starting to cook but are
            not yet browned.</li>
        <li>Remove potatoes from oil and scatter on a wire rack. Increase oil temperature to 375°F Once oil is heated to
            that temperature, return the potatoes to the fryer and cook until potatoes are golden brown. Remove to a
            paper towel-lined bowl.</li>
        <li>To Prepare Poutine: Add your fried or baked fries to a large, clean bowl. Season lightly with salt while
            still warm. Add a ladle of hot poutine gravy to the bowl and using tongs, toss the fries in the gravy. Add
            more gravy, as needed to mostly coat the fries.</li>
        <li>Add the cheese curds and toss with the hot fries and gravy. Serve with freshly ground pepper. Serve
            immediately.</li>
    </ol>
